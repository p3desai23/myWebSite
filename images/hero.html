<p> Kanye West was born on June 8, 1977 in Atlanta, Georgia but moved shortly after to the city of Chicago, where he grew up. Kanye always had a passion for music and made a name for himself with his production work on Jay-Z's 2001 album, Blueprint. Many speculated that Kanye could never be a successful rapper; however, he proved everyone wrong when his first studio album in 2004, the College Dropout, peaked at #2 on billboard charts and won the GRAMMY for best rap album. Since then, Kanye has released many classic albums, won 21 GRAMMYs, opened a successful clothing line, and cemented himself as one of the greatest musicians of all time.   
      
      
<p> I chose Kanye as my hero for a couple reasons. Kanye West is one of my favorite arists of all time. On top of that, he is also an incredible producer. I also admire him because he branched off of his music success and became very successful in business. The last reason I chose Kanye as my hero is that even though he sometimes says controversial statements, I respect the fact that he always speaks his mind, no matter the consequence.
