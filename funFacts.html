/*************** Algorithm ******************
1.First create an array that stores list of examples of topic 
2.Then create an array that stores a list of funfacts for those topics
3.then make function(start) and function(getIndex) be connected
4.then you need a for loop to loop through var group once
5.you need that loop to aquire what element of group array was selected
6.you need the same corresponding fact to be displayed
7.you must write an if-statement testing if an error has occurred
8.you need "an error has occured" to alert if this is the case and if an error hasn't occured, you need to display the fact.
